# Rapidez Image Resizer

Instead of just loading the full and big images from Magento this extension resizes the images. This works by passing the Magento image path through the image route: `/image/{size}/{file}`. Let's say a product image is located at: `https://magentowebsite.com/media/catalog/product/a/a/product-image.jpg` the path will be `/catalog/product/a/a/product-image.jpg`. To get this image with a maximum width of 200 pixels you go to: `/image/200/catalog/product/a/a/product-image.jpg`. If you also want to specify a maximum height: `/image/200x200/catalog/product/a/a/product-image.jpg`.

Keep in mind that you've to whitelist all sizes to avoid ddos attacks! Publish the config with `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rapidez\ImageResizer\ImageResizerServiceProvider" --tag=config` and specify the sizes you want.

Images are downloaded from the media url (see `config/rapidez.php`) and stored in `/storage/app/public/resizes`. Make sure the storage is linked with `php artisan storage:link`.
